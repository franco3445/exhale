# breath-trainer

## Introduction

Research shows that we blink less and breathe more shallowly when we are looking at screens. This app is intended as a friendly indicator and reminder to continue to take full and deep breaths.

## Usage

```sh
git clone https://github.com/peterklingelhofer/breath-trainer.git
cd breath-trainer
python main.py
```

You will be prompted for a preferred in and out duration, in seconds. For beginners who don't know what a good values for these, I recommend keeping it simple, using `4` for the in duration and `4` for the out duration. Eventually you can work your way up to `6` and `8`, and set the out duration to be twice that of the in duration to facilitate activation of the parasympathetic nervous system.
