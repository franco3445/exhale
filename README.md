# breath-trainer

## Introduction

Research indicates we blink less and breathe more shallowly when we are looking at screens. This app is intended as a friendly indicator and reminder to continue to take full and deep breaths.

## Usage

```sh
git clone https://github.com/peterklingelhofer/breath-trainer.git
cd breath-trainer
python main.py
```

You will be prompted for a preferred in and out duration, in seconds. For beginners who don't know what a good values for these, I recommend keeping it simple, using `4` for the in duration and `4` for the out duration. Eventually you can work your way up to `6` and `8`, and set the out duration to be twice that of the in duration to facilitate activation of the parasympathetic nervous system.

You can click and drag from the corners of the window to resize it to your liking. If you want to experiment with this, I would recommend resizing it to occupy a moderately thin horizontal region on the right side of your screen, while spanning from bottom to top vertically, so that you can track it in your peripheral vision.
