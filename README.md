## Introduction

Research indicates we blink less and breathe more shallowly when we are looking at screens. This app is intended as a friendly indicator and reminder to continue to take full and deep breaths. As looking at screens for long periods of time is typically less than ideal, this tool is intended as a means to potentially help soften the blow.

Each of these implementations allows users to set an inhale, inhale hold, exhale, and exhale hold duration, in seconds, to fit their needs. For beginners who might be curious what a good starting value might be for these, I recommend keeping it simple, using `4` for the in duration and `4` for the out duration. Eventually you can work your way up to `6` and `8`, and set the out duration to be twice that of the in duration to facilitate activation of the parasympathetic nervous system. Some users might like to start out with box breathing, which is inhale `4`, inhale hold `4`, exhale `4`, exhale hold `4`. Remember, if intense feelings arise while practicing, taking a break is encouraged - it's important to not overdo it.

## Download 

You can download the build for your respective operating system on the [Releases](https://github.com/peterklingelhofer/exhale/releases) page. Using the latest release is recommended, but if you run into issues you could try a previous release to see if that yields better results. If you do encounter a problem, please [document the issue you encountered](https://github.com/peterklingelhofer/exhale/issues/new).

## Mac App Usage

Note: This is built natively in Swift.

To launch the app on Catalina or newer, you may have to right click and select "Open" instead of double clicking on it. That's Apple's take on "security" for non-notarized binaries, or if you are not connected to the Internet.

You can use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>,</kbd> to toggle settings open and closed. The **Pause** feature can be used to tint your screen or make your screen darker than otherwise possible for nighttime work (which can compound with both [Night Shift](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102191) and [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/peterklingelhofer/exhale.git
cd exhale
cd swift
xed .
```

## Windows & Linux App Usage

Note: This implementation is built with TypeScript & Electron. The macOS will build but it is not very performant and is far more CPU-intensive than the native Swift build, and as a result the Swift build is recommended for macOS users.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/peterklingelhofer/exhale.git
cd exhale
cd typescript
yarn
yarn start
```

To recompile automatically and use [electron-reload](https://github.com/yan-foto/electron-reload), run in a separate terminal:

```sh
yarn run watch
```

Modify settings by going to **Application** (found in the top right via `>>`) > **Local storage** > **file://**. While the Developer Tools are open, you can resize the window, and opacity values are ignored, so you can position the window and change settings to your liking, and then close the Dev Tools window by clicking the `x` in the top right, or use <kbd>F12</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd>(Linux/Windows) or <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> (macOS) to toggle Developer Tools to [access and modify these settings](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/storage/localstorage/#edit), and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> (Linux/Windows) or <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> (macOS) to refresh the app to use your newly selected settings. If no settings appear on the first run of the application, you can manually add them), following the format of the `storedValues` variable in [`/src/renderer.ts`](https://github.com/peterklingelhofer/exhale/blob/main/src/renderer.ts). To add them manually, go to the **Console** and copy paste the following code into the console and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Return</kbd> to populate your `localStorage` (these are the defaults as of the time of writing):

```ts
localStorage = {
  colorExhale = "rgb(0, 0, 255)",
  colorInhale = "rgb(255, 0, 0)",
  colorStyle = "linear", // can be "linear" or "constant"
  shape = "fullscreen", // can be "circle" or "rectangle" or "fullscreen"
  durationInhale = 5,
  durationPostInhalePause = 0,
  durationExhale = 10,
  durationPostExhalePause = 0,
  opacity = 0.25,
};
```

Once added, you can modify all values from the **Local Storage** pane. Or, if you prefer the terminal, in the **Console** you can write `localStorage.opacity = "0.15"` for example.

## Python Script Usage

![exhalePython](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60944077/222979803-c88ebc65-b799-4ca7-b265-54beb27fcb00.gif)

Note: This implementation seems to work well on Windows and macOS, but not Linux for some reason.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/peterklingelhofer/exhale.git
cd exhale
cd python
python main.py
```

Modify variables at the top of the file for preferred in and out duration, in seconds.

For the full-screen resizable version, use, `IS_FULL_SCREEN = True` which makes the window entirely resizable by clicking and dragging from the corners.
